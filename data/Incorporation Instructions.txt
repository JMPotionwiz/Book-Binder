This datapack was mostly designed to be incorporated into other data packs, and by accident, I had made it rather
easy to do so.

Simply copy the entire "book_binder" folder and paste it into the "data" folder of your data pack!


"<world_name>"
 \_"datapacks"
    \_"Book Binder"
       \_"data"
          \_"book_binder" <-- Copy this folder...


"<world_name>"
 \_"datapacks"
    \_"<name of your awesome datapack>"
       \_"data" <-- ... And paste it into this one. (or you could just move it or something...)


That's it! Alternatively, you could just install this datapack seperatly, and tell everyone that it's a required
dependency or something.
